If watermarking is used, this should be set to the name of the file that will be used as the watermark. It should be a GIF file, for best results, use contrasting colours and transparency. In the Contrib directory, 3 example files are included. The filename is relative to the image directory, defined above.=
If you have defined the precise location of a place (using the mapping feature), Zoph can 'guess' the timezone based on this location. It uses the Geonames project for this. This will, however, send information to their webserver, do not enable this feature if you're not comfortable with that.=

Sometimes, you may wish to share an image in Zoph without creating a user account for those who will be watching them. For example, in order to post a link to an image on a forum or website. When this option is enabled, you will see a 'share' tab next to a photo, where you will find a few ways to share a photo, such as a url and a HTML &lt;img&gt; tag. With this special url, it is possible to open a photo without logging in to Zoph. You can determine per user whether or not this user will see the tab and therefore the urls.=

The salt for mid size images (this one) must be different from the salt of full images (above), because this allows Zoph to distinguish between them.

This is the Zoph user that is used when using the CLI interface when interacting with Zoph. This user must be an admin user. You can also set it to "autodetect", which means Zoph will lookup the name of the Unix user starting the CLI client and tries to find that user's name in the Zoph database.=

Watermarking can display a (copyright) watermark over your full-size images.=
Watermarking only works if the watermark file below is set to an existing GIF image. Please note that enabling this function uses a rather large amount of memory on the webserver. PHP by default allows a script to use a maximum of 8MB memory. You should probably increase this by changing memory_limit in php.ini. A rough estimation of how much memory it will use is 6 times the number of megapixels in your camera. For example, if you have a 5 megapixel camera, change memory_limit in php.ini to 30M=
Watermarking=
Welcome %s. %s currently contains=
When using the sharing feature, Zoph uses a hash to identify a photo. Because you do not want people who have access to you full size photos (via Zoph or otherwise) to be able to generate these hashes, you should give Zoph a secret salt so only authorized users of your Zoph installation can generate them. The salt for full size images (this one) must be different from the salt of mid size images (below), because this allows Zoph to distinguish between them. If a link to your Zoph installation is being abused (for example because someone whom you mailed a link has published it on a forum), you can modify the salt to make all hash-based links to your Zoph invalid.=
With geocoding you can lookup the location of a place from it's name. Here you can select the provider. Currently the only one available is 'geonames'=
With this feature you can use download a set of photos (Albums, Categories, Places, People or a search result) in one or more ZIP files. Important! The photos in the ZIP file will NOT be watermarked. You must also grant each non-admin user you want to give these rights permission by changing "can download zipfiles" in the user's profile.=
Yes=
You can enable or disable the "mail this photo feature" using this option. Since Zoph needs to convert the photo into Base64 encoding for mail, it requires quite a large amount of memory if you try to send full size images and you may need to adjust memory_limit in php.ini, you should give it at least about 4 times the size of your largest image.=
You can upload a single image or a zip or tar file of images.=
You have enabled autocompletion for one or more dropdown boxes on this page, however, you do not seem to have Javascript support. You should either enable javascript or turn autocompletion off, or this page will not work as expected!=

Zoph is free software.=
Zoph needs a MIME Magic file to be able to determine the filetype of an uploaded file. This is an important security measure, since it prevents users from uploading files other than images and archives. If left empty, PHP will use the built-in Magic file, if for some reason this does not work, you can specify the location of the MIME magic file. Where this file is located, depends on your distribution, /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc, /usr/share/misc/file/magic.mgc, /usr/share/file/magic are often used.=
