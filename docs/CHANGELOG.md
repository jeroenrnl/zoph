# Zoph Changelog #
## Zoph 0.9.7 ##
### 19 jan 2018 ###
I have had a very busy year and little time to spend on Zoph, but last december, I finally found time to finish what I had originally planned for 0.9.6: a complete rewrite of the search screen and the search engine. Most of the code in that part of Zoph was over 10 years old and had become quite messy over the years. The search engine is really the core of Zoph: if you open an album in Zoph, under the hood, Zoph really executes a search for all the photos in that album. This makes this code really important and I've made sure to cover all this by automated tests (UnitTests) before making any changes.


* [issue#83](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/83) Complete rewrite of the search page and the core functions of Zoph, including modernization of several other part of Zoph.
* [issue#90](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/90) Error displayed when adding a new place
* [issue#99](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/99) Geolocation doesn't work when using https
* Documentation updates - not all files were correctly displayed using Github's Markdown interpreter

## Zoph 0.9.6 ##
### 14 apr 2017 ###
Zoph 0.9.5 coincided with a significant change in MySQL, that caused a lot of bugs in Zoph and other open source projects. MySQL changed the way they process queries to handle them much more strictly. What makes things worse, is that MariaDB did not make this change, so at first I could not reproduce the issue. Because of the amount of work, I have decided to postpone the development that was planned for 0.9.6 and make this a bugfix-only release. In this release, I have included a few bugfixes by Pontus Fröding which is really great, thanks Pontus!

## Zoph 0.9.3 ##
### 10 jun 2016 ###

Zoph 0.9.3 is the new stable release. It is recommended for everyone to upgrade to this release

### Features ###
* [Issue #72](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/72) Zoph now has a new logon screen.
The logon screen has background photos. Two of them are already included in Zoph. You can place your own backgrounds in ```templates/default/images/backgrounds```. Or, you can (on the config screen) define an album from which the images will be used as background images. Zoph will display a random image as background.
* [Issue #76](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/76) The logon screen now gives a message about the username and/or password being wrong instead of just returning to the same screen
* [Issue #75](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/75) Zoph now uses PHP's password hashing algorithm instead of MySQL's.
This includes a random 'salt' added to each password. This will make it much, much harder to decrypt your passwords, if your database would ever fall into the wrong hands. The old hashes will be updated with the new ones as soon the the user logs in. Zoph will continue to support the old password hashes at least until v0.9.5.
* [Issue #26](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/26) It is now possible to define the cookie expirement time. In previous versions of Zoph, a user would be logged out when closing the browser. Is now possible to extend the time to 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours, 1 day, 1 week or 1 month. This means a user will not need to re-login for that period of time, even when the browser is closed in the mean time. This can be very convenient, but it could mean that a user leaves Zoph logged in on a public PC. Therefore, the default is still 'session', which means a user will be logged out when closing the browser.
* "new" pages now show up in breadcrumbs
* It is now possible to give a user "can see all photos" access rights. This means you can give a user access to all photos, without giving him/her admin rights and without having to update user rights whenever an album is added.
* [Issue #22](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/22) It is now possible to allow a user to create albums, categories, people, circles and places. The user automatically has access rights to place photos in the albums, categories, people, circles and places he or she has created.
* [Issue #21](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/21) It is now possible to allow a user to delete photos. The user will have to have "write" access to at least one album a photo is in.
* Remove the rather ugly trailing space on the links on zoph.php

### Bugs ###
* [Issue #73](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/73) Fixed sharing feature
* [Issue #74](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/74) Fixed Canadian English, Dutch and German translation files

### Other improvements ###
* Added a way to disable a setting on the configuration page depending on the state of another configuration item. (This was created because the photo album as a logon background relies on the sharing feature to be enabled).
* Moved user page to template
* Moved form into a separate class
* Some cleanup of the places and categories pages
* Refactor HTML for actionlinks
* Modified createTestData script to only require password once
* Rearranged order of unittests
* Added translations for German, Canadian English and Dutch

## Zoph 0.9.2 ##
### 1 apr 2016 ###

Zoph 0.9.2 is the new stable release. I have decided to drop the separation between 'stable' and 'unstable' or 'feature' releases. This means that it is recommended for everyone to upgrade to this release.

### Features ###
* [Issue #44](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/44) : Added 'circles': a way to group people in Zoph. This is especially handy if you have a large amount of people in your Zoph, and the 'person' page is becoming confusing or cluttered.
* [Issue #46](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/46) A circle and it's members can be surpressed in the overview page, so you can, for example, hide people that you added only for a small set of photos.
* [Issue #20](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/20) Zoph has switched to the PDO classes for database access. This ensures compatibility with PHP in the future, because the old mysql libs will be dropped soon.
* [Issue #32](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/32) It is now possible to set more properties of a photo, including map zoom from the web import.
* [Issue #60](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/60) The link text for "next" and "previous" as well as page numbers has been increased in size for better usability esp. on mobile devices
* Added a script for fixing filename case (by Jason Taylor [@JiCit] )
* Access Google maps via https (Jason Taylor [@JiCiT])
* As of this version, the language files are in the php dir, and no longer need to be copied or moved separately

### Bugs ###
* [Issue #49](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/49) Zoph now supports MySQL strict mode
* [Issue #55](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/55) Autocomplete not working for people
* [Issue #58](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/58) Sort order for albums and categories can not be changed
* CLI: Fixed an issue where Zoph would try to import to the current directory when double spaces were present in CLI
* Better handling of file not found problems during import
* Fixed two bugs that caused maps not to display
* Fixed an issue where breadcrumbs wouldn't be removed correctly in some cases
* Changed erronous extension of Exception class
* Fixed slow login times for non-admin users
* Improved performance on people page
* Fixed: zoom buttons are missing from Google Maps
* Remove duplicate files from import (if you would specify the same file twice on CLI import, you would get an error, this is now filtered out)
* Fixed an issue where the person pulldown on the add user page appeared to be empty
* Remove a user from a group when a the user is deleted
* Fixed a warning about unknown variable on places page
* Allow apostropes in place names when creating map markers (Jason Taylor [@JiCiT])

### Refactor ###
* A complete new query builder has been created
* Many more parts of Zoph can be (and are being) tested automatically now, this should improve overall quality and reduce bugs
* Many parts of Zoph have been cleaned up to modernize code to the current state of PHP - dropping PHP 5.3 and 5.4 compatibility
* Dropped MSIE6/7 compatibility
* Added documentation to many parts of Zoph's source code
* Many changes to readability of source code, such as more consistent use of whitespace
* Added some more debugging possibilities to easier troubleshoot in case of problems
* Changed logging so less logging is displayed when set to log::NONE
* Changed all self:: references into static:: references
* Added function scope to many methods
* Started using namespaces to better organize the classes
* Updated version numbers in REQUIREMENTS readme. 
* [Issue #8](https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/8) (partial) Changed several parts of Zoph to use templates 
* Added improvements to templating system
* Modified query for photo access rights to a view for performance reasons
* Changed logging so SQL query log to file can be done without displaying
