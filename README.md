# Zoph 0.9.7 Readme #

## Introduction ##

Zoph (*Z*oph *O*rganizes *Ph*otos) is a web based digital image presentation
and management system. In other words, a photo album. It is built with
PHP and MySQL.

Many people store their photos in the digital equivalent of a shoe box:
lots of directories with names like 'Holiday 2008', 'January 2005' or
even 'Photos034'. Like shoe boxes, this is a great way to put your
photos away, but not such a great way to find them back or even look at
them. Zoph can help you to store your photos and keep them organized.

While most photo album projects are primarily targeted at showing your
photos to others, Zoph is primarily targeted at keeping your photos
organized for yourself, giving you granular control over what you'd 
like to show to others, on a per-album or even a per-photo basis.

If you just want to generate a gallery of thumbnails from a bunch of
images, you may want to try one of the other numerous photo album
projects. But if you want to also store additional information about
your photos, search them, or control access to them, take a look at Zoph.
