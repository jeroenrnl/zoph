Zoph Changelog
Zoph 0.7.0.6
2 July 2009

Zoph 0.7.0.6 is an update of the stable 0.7 branch and fixes a cross site scripting security bug.

Bugs
* Fix for a cross site scripting bug that was reported by "y3nh4ck3r".

Zoph 0.7.0.5
20 July 2008

Zoph 0.7.0.5 is a security fix that repairs several SQL injections. Although most are not exploitable or only exploitable by an admin user, I recommend upgrading to 0.7.0.5. This release also includes a number of extra 'safety nets' that will make exploiting any future SQL injections a lot harder.

It also fixes a number of bugs in the 0.7 release:

    * Bug#1813293: import is not compatible with PHP < 5
    * Bug#2006151: one of the '+' buttons on the search page does not work
    * Bug#2012300: Missing linefeed on places page.
    * Bug#2015312: Wrong layout for 'work' field on person page.
    * Bug#2015346: Home location does not display the title
    * Bug#2021272: Crash when changing the parent of the root album


Zoph 0.7.0.4
26 May 2008

This is a bugfix release that fixes a few bugs in the 0.7 release.

    * Bug#1923507: pleasewait.gif missing
    * Bug#1926107 SQL error because of dashed line in zoph.sql
    * Bug#1923955: photo x of y is not correctly translated
    * Bug#1928150: tree view shows a "+" even though the branch is already open
    * Bug#1928671: Notify mail doesn't work
    * Perl chokes when the .zophrc file ends with a negative assignment (" = 0"), adding "1;" to make sure it always ends "positively".
    * Bug#1964408 Garbled layout on prefs page.

Very small new feature: the photo is now shown when asking for confirmation of deletion
